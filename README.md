# dotfiles
A collection of all my files used to customize various Linux machines i have set up.
I really like using linux with transparency and occationally some blur, or a nice theme i've made myself

## TODO
* Sort the different scripts and configs according to which machine they were designed for
* Make directory for universal configs

## Machines currently using these configs:
* My laptop
* My raspberry PI's
* My tablet
* Termux on my phone
* My old phone running PostmarketOS
